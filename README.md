  * [Task 1] Intro
  
  Burp Suite, a framework of web application pentesting tools, is widely regarded as the de facto tool to use when performing web app testing. Throughout this room, we'll take a look at the basics of installing and using this tool as well as it's various major components. Reference links to the associated documentation per section have been provided at the bottom of most tasks throughout this room.

The virtual machine used in this room (OWASP JuiceShop) can be installed from this [link](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop#from-sources) or via [Heroku](https://elements.heroku.com/buttons/bkimminich/juice-shop) (in case that you'd like to do this room in a sort of offline mode, otherwise you can launch the VM below as per normal). The JuiceShop project is an intentionally vulnerable web application created as part of the OWASP project. 

Prior to attempting this room, I highly recommend checking out the ['Web Fundamentals'](https://tryhackme.com/room/webfundamentals) room by [NinjaJc01](https://tryhackme.com/p/NinjaJc01). If you are familiar with basic web request structure and SQL injection, you're already set!
